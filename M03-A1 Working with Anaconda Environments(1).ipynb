    "# Assignment: Creating, Using, and Deleting Conda Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "A *conda enviornment* is a virtual environment implemented as a folder that contains conda packages you have installed. A primary motivation to use virtual environments is to manage dependencies. For example, you may have a legacy project that requires an earlier version of ```numpy``` or ```pandas``` and a separate project for which you prefer to use the most recent versions. To accomplish this, you create virtual environments and specify the version of packages needed for that environment. Additionally, having unnecessary packages in your environment leads to inefficiencies and a higher probability of conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, if you are doing specialized work (e.g., a project that requires modules that you don't typically use), you may want to create an environment specifically for that project.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have used pip and virtualenv in the past, you can use conda to perform all of the same operations. Pip is a package manager and virtualenv is an environment manager. Conda is both.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is only an overview. For a much more detailed understanding of conda, see the docs (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html)."

    "Magics are specific to and provided by the IPython kernel. Whether Magics are available on a kernel is a decision that is made by the kernel developer on a per-kernel basis. To work properly, Magics must use a syntax element which is not valid in the underlying language. For example, the IPython kernel uses the % syntax element for Magics as % is not a valid unary operator in Python. (see https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html for more info)."
